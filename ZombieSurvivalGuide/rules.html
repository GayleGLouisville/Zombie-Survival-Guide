          Every minute of every day you should be equipped to kill a zombie. It doesn't have to be a gun or a flamethrower or a chainsaw, but it has to be capable of taking out a zombie at a moment's notice. A simple knife or a screwdriver will work.</p>

      <h3>Destroy the brain.</h3>
      <p>Most zombies won't die from just one hit unless it's a shot to the head, and it will instead get up in very little time - and will then bite you. The most effective way to prevent this is to take a second shot/hit to their head which will stop them from attacking again, and surely one more shot can't do too much harm! For this to work, you will need at least two shots in your gun at all times so you can double tap without having to worry about reloading in time (you usually won't get that time). Luckily, the second shot should be easier as the first shot should take the zombie to the floor and temporarily prevent the zombie from moving.</p>

      <h3>Stay with your group.</h3>
      <p>If you're lucky you'll happen upon a group of US Army Rangers when everything goes down. They're tough, well-coordinated, and won't freeze in terror at the sight of blood and guts. Chances are higher that you'll end up with a group of random people with varying skills and you will end up hating a few of them. Doesn't matter. Stay with your group. Never wander off alone to contemplate the corruption of your companions, because that is precisely the moment when the hordes will descend upon you and eat your highly moralled brain. There really is safety in numbers so stay with your group.</p>

      <h3>The Missing are Doomed.</h3>
      <p>Back before the zombies, if someone you knew went missing, then you looked for them. There were probably many uniformed people from several government agencies that helped you in your search. Random citizens were likely to join you in the effort especially if the missing person was a child. Not so post-zombie. If someone in your party goes missing, observe a moment of silence, shed a tear or two and move on. It's not cruel, it's survival. Likely the missing person broke Rule #2 so there's no excuse risking your lives searching for an idiot who wanders off and has probably already become a zombie snack.</p>

      <h3>Don't Go Out at Night.</h3>
      <p>This seems obvious, but the folks on <i>The Walking Dead</i> break this rule all the time. Usually they're searching for a missing member of their party, which, as we established in Rule #2, is a bad move. At night you can't see your companions and may accidentally shoot one. You also can't see the zombies. Yes, yes, I know you can walk very quietly with all your senses on high alert, but if he's leaning his half-dead self against a tree and doesn't animate until you pass by then you're a goner. And you should be. What the heck are you doing wandering around in a dark, zombie infested forest?</p>

      <h3>Keep Track of Your Kids.</h3>
      <p>I'm sure your first thought is that kids are a liability and I can't really argue that one. They are. But, as a mom, I still have to do my best to keep them alive. And the single best way I can do this is to know where the heck they are at all times. It would save the folks on <i>The Walking Dead</i> all kinds of trouble if they just knew Carl's whereabouts. But, no, Lori is too busy doing whatever it is she does and Carl is wandering. Alone. In the woods. At night. Eventually the group will turn on you when you convince them to risk their lives looking for your child and likely breaking the first three rules.</p>

      <h3>Be quiet.</h3>
      <p>It's the end of the world so try to avoid squealing like a 4th grade school girl and perhaps invest in some good sneakers. Nobody said you have to kill all the zombies and there is certainly no shame in sneaking around and surviving versus tearing around like a madman and ending up being an undead happy meal. Better to be a coward that is alive.</p>

<p>Of course, shotguns are the perfect one-shot-kill-all weapons of the zombie apocalypse, because even if you aren't good at aiming, a shotgun is likely to put down and keep down a zombie with one good shot. But the most important thing about a shotgun in a zombie apocalypse, anyone carrying a wooden-handled, black-barreled shotgun will always look badass, and there's nothing more important in the zombie apocalypse than looking badass with a shotgun.</p>
</div>

 <div class="dropdown-pane" id="handgun" data-dropdown data-hover="true" data-hover-pane="true"> <img src="img/Gun.png"/> <p>It should go without saying but you will absolutely need one of these. Sniper rifles and crossbows can be a bit harder to find but its well worth it if you don’t want to get zombie guts on your clothes.</p>
</div>

<div class="dropdown-pane" id="sword" data-dropdown data-hover="true" data-hover-pane="true"> <img src="img/Sword.png"/> <p>It’s inevitable, you will eventually run out of ammunition. Just don’t panic. Although any blunt object will do samurai swords come highly recommended. Designed to sever spines with a flick of the wrist, zombies shouldn't be too much of a problem.</p>
</div>

<div class="dropdown-pane" id="knife" data-dropdown data-hover="true" data-hover-pane="true"> <img src="img/Knife.png"/> <p>You can't survive out in the wild without an all-in-one survival knife. It's perfect for cooking animals you hunt, great for carving your name in trees to leave clues as to where you've been and it's perfect for picking the squirrel fur out of your teeth.</p>
</div>

<div class="dropdown-pane" id="machete" data-dropdown data-hover="true" data-hover-pane="true"> <img src="img/Machete.png"/><p>A full-sized axe is too heavy to carry in a sprint from a zombie horde, but a machete is just right!</p>
</div>

<div class="dropdown-pane" id="crowbar" data-dropdown data-hover="true" data-hover-pane="true"><img src="img/crowbar.png"/><p>Busting through doors like a boss is going to be very important in terms of survival. Not only will you often find yourself with your back literally up against the door but wasting ammunition to bust through it is a bit silly when you could just use a crowbar.</p>
</div>

<div class="dropdown-pane" id="bat" data-dropdown data-hover="true" data-hover-pane="true"><img src="img/bat.png"/><p>Nothing against Lucille, but bat usage as a weapon has some problems. To start, proximity is an issue. At no longer than 34 inches, the length of the longest bats made today, attacking a zombie with a bat means a close encounter. A single miss could be a catastrophic mistake.</p>
</div>

<div class="dropdown-pane" id="screwdriver" data-dropdown data-hover="true" data-hover-pane="true"><img src="img/screwdriver.png"/><p>You only need to destroy the brain. A screwdriver or an icepick both work really well for this. The issue with using a screwdriver is how close you have to get to the zombie. It is very effective at piercing the brain, but it requires some pretty close quarters. </p>
