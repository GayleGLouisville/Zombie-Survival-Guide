        <h1>Zombies, zombies and more zombies.</h1>
        <p class="heavy">
          Everywhere you look these days, you’re bound to run into a bunch of zombies. We’ve got books about zombies, television shows about zombies and tons of zombie movies, like the classic <i>The Night of the Living Dead</i>. There’s no escaping the eventual takeover of the earth by the undead, it seems, so you’d best learn how to deal with your future human flesh-eating neighbors now. Here’s some practical advice to get you started.

        <h2>Don't get bit.</h2>
        <p>
          That’s the first, and most important rule. If you do get bit, you can either off yourself, or tell your friends. There’s really no other choice, unless you’re aye okay with becoming one of the undead. “Hey guys, guess what just happened to me?” Don’t worry. We’re sure your friends will be very gentle with that axe, or that chainsaw, or that sawed-off shotgun.

        <h2>Use common sense.</h2>
        <p>
          Don’t elect a psychopath as your leader, and always keep your group together. This isn’t a ‘Scooby-Doo’ mystery — you’re trying to stay alive. No matter how tempting it is, never split up. There’s strength in numbers. When it’s just you and 120 zombies, your odds of survival decrease significantly.

By the time you say, “Now where did I leave my extra gun clip,” some nasty zombie has ripped your arm off, or your head.</p>

      <h1>Types of Zombies.</h1>
      <p class="heavy">Some zombies walk the walk but can't talk the talk, whether their brains are addled by infection or their tongues have simply rotted away. Some run, some scream, some are sick, some are dead, but they (almost) all have one thing in common: They're coming to get you, Barbara!</p>

        <h2>Recently Turned.</h2>
        <p>Now the one thing I want to point out with this zombie is that there could be some variation depending on how long it took the person to turn. For example the natural color might be less pronounced if they took several hours and their blood has started to pool. The danger posed by this particular type of zombie is that we might not even realize that she is a zombie until it’s too late. With this particular type we assume that the cause of zombieism is such that the person immediately turned upon being bit or infected in some other way. In this illustration I’ve stuck with the bite. Call me a traditionalist.</p>

        <h2>Shufflers.</h2>
        <p>What we’ve come to regard as the classic Romero Zombies, are slow moving flesh-eaters that shamble about the countryside clumsily stalking whatever humans might be unfortunate enough to cross their paths. The trick with them is that they may be slow, but if there are a lot of them, you might be in trouble.</p>
        <p>These zombies have some sort of damage to their legs that cause them to shamble and shuffle along at a relatively slow pace. Again, take caution here. Assume they are fast movers anyway just in case. They might be shuffling along more slowly but when riled many zombies have shown themselves to be pretty terrifying. Even the slow ones. </p>

        <h2>Runners.</h2>
        <p>Runners scare the hell out of me. As a kid I was already scared by the Romero type shamblers and shufflers but once I caught a glimpse of the runners in <i>Return of the Living Dead</i> I was terrified. These days runners seem to have taken over for their shear fear factor. From movies like <i>28 Days Later</i> to the remake of <i>Dawn of the Dead</i>, fast zombies have become the norm. Fresh ones might look like regular people and in some cases it could be hard to tell a blood covered soon-to-be victim running for their lives from a blood thirsty horror running for your life. They aren’t content to slowly shamble about and bump up against a boarded up farm house, they will tear the house and themselves apart to get inside. Fortunately though, they aren’t any stronger than regular humans and strong barricades that hold out humans should also hold back the undead.</p>

        <h2>Crawlers.</h2>
        <p>Crawlers are some of the most disturbing zombies in pop culture. From the brilliant half-bodied redhead who came in the window in <i>Return of the Living Dead</i> to the half creature Rick encounters in the premier of <i>The Walking Dead</i>. The very fact that large parts of their bodies are missing is freaky as hell.</p>
        <p>The danger posed by these nasties is that they could be in a lot of places you wouldn’t expect, small crawl spaces, under cars, hidden in tall grass where you can’t see them. Fortunately with large parts of their bodies gone, their mobility is seriously cut down and it becomes a lot easier to take them out.</p>

        <h2>Hordes.</h2>
        <p>It’s your greatest fear. An entire horde of zombies. Even a small group of shufflers can be dealt with on your own. With fast zombies, you stand a chance in a one on one fight. Maybe you can even take out a few if you have the right weapon or the right position. But it’s not like that with hordes. Hordes are an animal all their own. In large groups the zombies seem to get agitated and the chances of survival plummet.</p>
