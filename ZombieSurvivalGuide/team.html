          There’s nothing worse than taking on a zombie invasion all by your lonesome, so make sure that you have a crew. The key to surviving your Zombie Apocalypse is in putting together a well-rounded team of badasses who complement each other. Each should bring a skill to the table that you definitely want on your side come zombie-stompin' time. And, as we have learned with zombie movies over the years, there are basically 8 main roles on your crew.</p>

          A calm, steady type who's not afraid to take charge and make decisions. You might look to folks in law enforcement or some other form of public service. Just be aware that the stress of leadership during the zombie apocalypse can bring out the worst in people, so try to avoid megalomaniacs and psychopaths.</p>

        <p>This is a one-woman murder machine, a harbinger of death for any undead or human that has the misfortune to cross her path. And you don't survive for as long or get out of as many impossible situations as she has, without having a damn-near encyclopedic knowledge of weapons. Knives, swords, pistols, machine guns, axes, pipes, whatever's at her disposal.</p>

        <p>The zombie apocalypse can really get you down. This is why you might want to consider including a nurturing, optimistic soul with a sympathetic ear and ability to cheer up even the bleakest of situations. This role is often filled by elementary school teachers, psychologists, and prostitutes-with-hearts-of-gold. Know any of those?</p>

        <p>Brawn and ass-kicking skills are all well and good, but at some point they will fail you. That's when you need someone with brains on your team. You'll want a strategist, someone to think around corners and plan, someone to figure out ways to keep your team alive. And, in the event that fails, you'll need an historian, someone to document what happens. Someone needs to coordinate, figure out the logistics of moving your team from point A to point B, able to think quickly on their feet when shit goes awry. And shit will definitely go awry.</p>

        <p>Having a skilled, tough medic on your team is the difference between survival, and losing your wild warrior to a zombie bite or your leader to an unexpected allergic reaction. Proving herself particularly adept at survival and grittier than she appears is not to be overlooked: The longer your medic stays alive, the longer your team stays alive. </p>

        <p>Chefs have a variety of skills that are actually quite useful in this scenario. Chefs are great at working under pressure and making the most out of what’s available, which in this case would equate to “not a lot”. Plus, chefs are especially handy with knives. </p>

        <h2>Guy who dies first.</h2>
        <p>In a situation where being in decent physical shape and able to run fast are two things that will keep you alive, the opposite of those things will almost assuredly get you killed. And fairly quickly, unless you have a team of people both willing and able to protect you until you get back on your feet rather than cutting you loose as dead weight. This is why people with grievous injuries or terminal illnesses almost always offer themselves up as bait or a distraction, because they know the harsh reality is that they're only slowing the group down and it's only a matter of time until they are killed.</p>

<p class="heavy"> Once you've assembled a respectable Zombie Survival Team, agree to rendezvous as quickly as possible at a pre-selected site which will provide ample shelter, food, water, and other supplies for what might end up being months — even years. Shopping malls are popular zombie-defying spots, as are school cafeterias, jails, and big box warehouse stores (causing some quipsters to note an added layer of protection: zombies can't get in without a membership card.) Places to avoid include hospitals and law enforcement agencies, since everyone else (and the zombies) will go there first and wreak havoc on the place.</p>
